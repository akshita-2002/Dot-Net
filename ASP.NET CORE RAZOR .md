- to develop a web application in .NET we have two ways
1. using framework : using asp.net
2. using core : using asp.net core Razor or asp.net core mvc



## WHY NOT ASP.NET

-  ASP.NET only for windows , whereas asp.net core is for windows,mac and linux

- asp.net core has better performance

- asp.net core runs on both .NET core and framework

- Asp.Net supports web forms (everything is drag and drop Eg: drag and drop button, the code is written automaticaaly in web form)

- Aso.Net uses only IIS web server, whereas Asp.Net core is not dependent on IIS

- Asp.Net core supports more languages than asp.net

- asp.net core stores files in json whereas asp.net stores in xml

- asp.net core supports containers such as docker

- asp.net core -> no need to comiple the file again and again when changes are made in code, refreses automatically once file is saved.
